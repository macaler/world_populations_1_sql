# world_populations_1_sql

This project is one of several Codecademy Pro Challenge Projects that I have completed. The main goal of the project was to practice SQL querying on a data set containing populations of various countries; the years covered range from 2000 to 2010 inclusive. In this project, relatively simple SELECT statements involving Boolean logic are utilized. 

I used SQLite when completing this project.

The file "population_queries_MAC" contains the Codecademy prompts and my solutions to those prompts. 

Codecademy does not say where they got the data they distributed with this project, so I will assume that I do not have permission to share that database on my own GitHub account.
